\cf0 Two new main features:\
\
\'95 Saves desktop icons positions & windows sizes and positions with display layouts: you can have different desktop layouts (with and without an second monitor for example), and switch automatically between the layouts when you plug or unplug your monitor\
\
\'95 Allows to disable a plugged display without unplugging it. Uses can be: having a TV always plugged to the Mac, but not willing to use it, without having to disconnect it physically; or use a laptop on external display  with the internal screen dimmed...\
\
Some lesser features:\
\'95 Brings a shortcut to System Monitors Preferences\cf2 \
\cf0 \'95 Corrects a missing feature where the previous resolution was not applied back after a restart\
\'95 Shows the Blanking & Total values when creating a new timing\
\'95 Displays the localised floating point values in the exported EDID data\

\cf0 Lots of new features in this version. Most features were taken from user reviews (requests or rants).\
\'95 On Tiger: SwitchResX saves (and restores) Finder Icons positions and Desktop Windows positions and sizes.\
  This is the comeback of a long wanted feature, that was there on Mac OS 9 and often asked back\
\'95 The Control Panel can be launched just to tweak monitor settings without installing SwitchResX completely if you don't need all the features, in which case the interface is simplified\
\'95 Can now change the default resolution used after restart: that should avoid situations where a new resolution could be added, enabled by the System, and used, but the monitor would stay black, (and the user thought it destroyed its monitor)\
\'95 Can now edit advanced settings (new resolutions, monitor characteristics, ...) of unattached monitors, if you know their vendor ID\
\'95 Lets you copy and paste the parameters of custom resolutions as Windows "Powerstrip" or X11 "Modeline" settings that you can find on the web - no need to make the conversion to enter the parameters in SwitchResX, it does that automatically for you\
\'95 Includes the Kagi Registration Module for direct registration from within SwitchResX itself\
\'95 More resolutions are shown as VESA timings that can be enabled\
\'95 Universal Binary available, although the x86 version is not fully tested\
\
\'95 Changed the positions of files: now less items are installed on your disk\
\'95 Interface has been slightly changed, to take user remarks into account: it should be less difficult - the About Box is also simplified\
\'95 Simplified and removed unused functions\
\'95 SwitchResX enters the registration data automatically if it finds some in the Clipboard\

\'95 Corrects a problem in the Contextual Menu module that was crashing the Finder when FruitMenu 3.1 was installed\
\
\cf2 SwitchResX 3.1\cf0 \
\'95 Use an APE module for:\

When APE is not installed, then SwitchResX 3.1 behaves the same way SwitchResX 3.0 is acting.\
